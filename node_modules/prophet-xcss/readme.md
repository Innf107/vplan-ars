# prophet-xcss

**This has nothing to do with xCSS! I just came up with the same name and noticed it was already taken later.**

This is a very simple preprocessor library for express to use different css styles for desktop and mobile. 

*prophet-xcss is completely backwards compatible with regular css.*


**In order to use this library, you simply have to include it in your express server like this:**
```javascript
const express = require('express')
const xcss = require('prophet-xcss')
const app = express()

app.use(xcss(['.', './css'])) 
//Include all directories, where you want to use prophet-xcss. 
//File paths can be absolute or relative! 
```


You can now write both desktop and mobile styles in your css, by just seperating them with a +
```css
body{
    background-color: red + blue;
    /*This is now going to be red on desktop and blue on mobile*/

    font-size: _ + 200%;
    /*Use a _ if you want the property to not exist on one platform.*/
}
```

This gets served to a desktop user as
```css
body{
    background-color: red;
}
```

To a mobile user it will look like this
```css
body{
    background-color: blue;

    font-size: 200%;
}
```

# Options

#### Fast Mode
```javascript
app.use(xcss(['./css'], {fastMode:true}))
```

* Fast mode is disabled by default.
* Fast mode caches the final CSS, so it does not
have to recalculate the css for each request.
* This can especially improve performance if you 
have a lot of CSS.
* You have to restart your
server every time you make any changes to the CSS!

#### Verbose
```javascript
app.use(xcss(['./css'], {verbose:true}))
```

* The verbose flag is disabled by default.
* Similar to the --verbose flag on a lot of cli-tools, 
it logs a lot of additional information to the console.
* This might be useful for debugging, but verbose mode should **NOT**
be used in production code!
